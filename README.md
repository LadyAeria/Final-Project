# 3.2
So far I have a title screen and main screen active and working for the game. The framework goes from the title screen first to the main screen after clicking a specific key. I am still trying to figure out how to get the clickaable buttons to disappear so I can have only one specific character appear for the close up interaction.

I plan to make an rpg-like game where you interact with characters with different stages/conditions/settings (based on the five stages of grief or focus on different disabilities)

Week 1: Research games for inspiration for 3.0 project.

Week 2: Familiarize with some of the libraries in p5.js that I plan to use 
        Using clickable library for clickable character interactions

Week 3: Create three separate game screens under said conditions
        Make Start, Clickable characters, and close up interaction screen
        A lot of trial and error tests to make the code work

Week 4: Finalize and add characters, make better visuals for the game
