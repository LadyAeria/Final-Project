# Final Project Planning
I plan to add more character interaction so that the user can choose dialogue choices to result in a different response from a selected character. I also plan to add an instructions screen, artist statement screen, and possibly and ending screen once the user finishes interacting with all the characters.

Week 1: Work on more clickables for user interaction and add more screens.

Week 2: Draw more visuals for the game itself

Week 3: Brush and touch up code for better visuals and add music (if possible)
