# Final Project Planning
So far I have a title screen and main screen active and working for the game. The framework goes from the title screen first to the main screen after clicking a specific key. I am still trying to figure out how to get the clickaable buttons to disappear so I can have only one specific character appear for the close up interaction.

I plan to make an rpg-like game where you interact with characters with different stages/conditions/settings (based on the five stages of grief or focus on different disabilities)

Week 1: Work on more clickables for user interaction and add more screens.

Week 2: Draw more visuals for the game itself

Week 3: Brush and touch up code for better visuals and add music (if possible)
